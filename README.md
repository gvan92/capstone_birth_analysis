Google Data Analytics Capstone Project

I created this project as a capstone for the Google Data Analytics program on Coursera. I decided to complete the entire project in R Studio to become more proficient in R. I also decided to find my own datasets so that I can encapsulate 7 steps of data analytics taught in the course which are ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act. 

The course was aim at entry level data analysis and did not include building any models for prediction. However, that could be something I explore further in R.
